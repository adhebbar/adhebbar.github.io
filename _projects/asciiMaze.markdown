Term project for Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science course, taken in fall 2016.  
- I used a recursive backtracking maze generator. 
- I used the python module Panda3D to reder a walkable version of the generated maze with walls containing ascii pictures.  
- I used the python module PIL (python imaging library) to convert a given picture into a picture made of ascii characters, and also insert clues about solving the maze.   

I was one of 15 selected as a finalist to present in front of peers and staff. (15 projects out of around 450 were selected)
