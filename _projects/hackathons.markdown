I'd consider myself a hackathon veteran, and have worked on several cool projects along the way. These are just a few.

1) Capone (Capital One Engineering summit hackathon)  
    Worked with a team to create a webapp that analyzes trends in one's spending patterns and forecasts their future spending patterns. It  consisted of an interactive bot, graphs and a calendar on a wepage to display the information, as well as a google home mini to interact with the bot. [View the webpage](http://capone-money.herokuapp.com/)

2) RoboCashCow (Tartan hacks 2018)
   Worked with a team to create robot that moves around and detects cash lying on the floor with google cloud machine learning, and adds the money to one's bank account. [DEMO VIDEO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rQDGbXOgt7y-5xClALo0pZuBhymzmkDU/view?usp=sharing) 

Won capital one prize for best use of capital one's API.

3) Soufi (Tartan Hacks 2017)  
Conceived and programmed a communication protocol between two computers
using ultrasound in python. I now realize realize that this sound awfully lot like modem, and thats pretty much what it was.
Won “new penguin” award for best idea with a proof of
concept.
