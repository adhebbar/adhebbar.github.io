For this week-long event hosted by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept at CMU, my team and I designed and constructed an editable hologram controlled using hand gestures.  

To do this, we used a leapmotion sensor to detect hand gestures and a TV reflected onto an acrylic pyramid to create the illusion that the objects are in 3-dimensional space. We used java in processing to render the 3-D graphics and manipulate the shapes drawn.
