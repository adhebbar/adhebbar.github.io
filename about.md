I'm majoring in electrical and computer engineering and am considering either double majoring or minoring in Computer science.
This semester, I'm excited to learn more about **functional programming**, **machine learning**, and **digital systems**.


So far, I've had experience with web developement, dabbled into robotics, played around with a lot of hardware, and experimented with
virtual reality. I'm extremely passionate about learning new technologies and having novel experiences, and given the chance, would 
love to take apart and put together everything I can get my hands on.


Feel free to get in touch with me!
